# docker-nodejs
This a project I made to understand how to create a dockerfile and this helped me understanding about .dockerignore file aND DOCKER file.
But still i don't know about node.js because i want to work in DevOps field and still i do't feel any necessity of it, but if it is needed i will learn it ASAP.
